The citizens of the town have banded together to form a tribunal: they will execute people one by one until the dastardly killings stop. Can you save your town before the mafia take over completely?",
        "lynch": "As {{victim}} is marched up the stand, they face the crowd. A serene sort of acceptance washes over their face; whatever their deeds, it's all over now. And ten minutes later, only a corpse remains, dangling from the lynching rope in full view of the public.",
        "kill": "As you gather in the square for today's tribunal, you notice that {{victim}} is missing. A quick search reveals the truth: {{victim}} has been slain in their bed overnight, a bullet left right between the eyes. The gory scene can only mean one thing: the mob has killed again.",
        "scumWin": "The remaining mafia members reveal themselves, openly taking over the town. It becomes a place of lawlessness, run by the big don, where normal people fail to tread.",
        "townWin": "As the last Mafia member dangles from the rope, a sense of profound relief washes over the remaining townsfolk. It will be alright now. Everything is fine once again. All you have to do is wash the last of the blood off your hands..."

The captain has already been keelhauled; it's up to his remaining crew to ferret out the scurvy knaves who hope to take over this ship and the hold full of booty. Can you wrest control and restore the pirate code?",
        "lynch": "{{victim}} is frog-marched to the rear of the deck, and with a little prodding, takes their place atop the plank. The crew is like a mob, jeering and throwing things. Someone prods them, and with a final round of curses, they walk off the end of the plank, vanishing beneath the waves. All retreat to their bunks, their grim work done.",
        "kill": "All hands are on deck but one -- {{victim}} must have over indulged in grog, the scurvy seadog. Someone goes to wake him, but he's not in his bunk either. His body, in fact, is dangling above the poop deck, having been hoisted in a makeshift noose off the mainsail. The mutineers have struck again!",
        "scumWin": "On a signal, the mutineers rush for the wheel, taking control of the ship both literally and figuratively. 'Argh! Ye all be answerin to a new captain now!', they shout.",
        "townWin": "Slowly, order is restored once more. A captain is elected, and the crew get back to their work. Once the ship reaches Antigua, the booty is sold, and the profits split. The ship's crew dissolves, each with their pockets full of gold -- the happiest ending a pirate can hope for."

Now the sheriff and the deputy both lie dead, and it's up to you to figure out who is trying to destroy this little mining town.",

So, not knowing who to trust, and with the boss in hiding, you decide to meet in the boss's mansion and put it to a vote. Each day, someone's going to face the justice of the family. Can you take out all the feds before they take the family down?",
        "lynch": "{{victim}} is shoved up against the wall. They turn to face the family, a sneer on their face. Their mouth opens, apparently ready to deliver one last speech of defiance, but they are interrupted as the rest of the family unloads into their body, leaving nothing but a bloody, ruined mess.",
        "kill": "As you gather in the main room for today's discussions, you notice that {{victim}} is missing. A quick search reveals {{victim}}'s room has been tossed, but no sign of them. The Feds must have snuck them out in the night.",

        "townWin": "As the last Fed lies bleeding at the base of the wall, a sense of satisfaction washes over the room. No one will bother the family for a long time after this. The only question now is what to do with all these bodies? Maybe a new guest house in the backyard?"
